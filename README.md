When it comes to diagnostic imaging, CT scans are among the most advanced and informative tools available. At Butler Medical Imaging, we provide state-of-the-art CT scan services to ensure accurate and detailed diagnostics for our patients. This blog will help you understand what a CT scan is, how it works, what to expect during your scan, and why choosing Butler Medical Imaging for your CT scan needs is the best decision you can make.
What is a CT Scan?
A CT scan, also known as Computerised Tomography or a ‘CAT’ scan, is an advanced imaging technique that uses specialised X-ray equipment to create detailed images of the inside of the body. Unlike regular X-rays, which capture a single image, CT scans take multiple images from different angles. These images are then processed by a sophisticated computer to create a 3-dimensional (3D) view of the scanned area.
Modern CT scanners, such as those used at Butler Medical Imaging, are referred to as Multi-Slice CT scanners. These machines can capture multiple slices of the body in a single rotation, providing incredibly detailed cross-sectional images of bones, organs, and blood vessels. CT scans offer more comprehensive information than plain X-rays, making them invaluable for diagnosing a wide range of conditions.
What Happens During a CT Scan?
When you arrive for your CT scan at Butler Medical Imaging, our friendly and professional staff will guide you through the process. Here’s what you can expect:
•	Preparation
Clothing and Accessories: You may be asked to change into a gown and remove any jewelry, eyeglasses, or metal objects that could interfere with the imaging.
Positioning: You will lie down on a motorized table that slides into the CT scanner, which is a large, doughnut-shaped machine. Our technician will ensure you are comfortably positioned.
•	During the Scan
Imaging Process:  The CT scanner will rotate around your body to take X-ray images from various angles. You will need to remain still during the scan to ensure clear and accurate images. You may also be asked to hold your breath for a few seconds at certain points.
Contrast Injection:  In some cases, a contrast agent (also known as contrast media, contrast material, or X-ray dye) may be injected into a vein in your arm. This helps highlight specific organs, blood vessels, and tissues in the images. You might experience a metallic taste, a sensation of warmth, or a need to urinate, but these sensations are temporary.
•	Duration
A CT scan typically takes between 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the area being examined. The actual scanning time is much shorter, often just a few seconds per rotation.
